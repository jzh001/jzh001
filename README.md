## About Me  

I am an undergraduate researcher passionate about Machine Learning, Graph Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, and Large Language Models.  
My work spans multi-objective reinforcement learning, agentic multimodal workflows, and open-source tools bridging research with practice.

- Former Visiting Academic at USC’s Institute for Creative Technologies, collaborating with the U.S. DEVCOM Army Research Lab  
- Undergraduate Researcher at UCLA Structures-Computer Interaction Lab, working on LLM-guided physics simulations and multi-agent systems  
- First-author publication in Springer Social Network Analysis and Mining, cited by Spotify Research (2024)  
- 2025 Samueli Undergraduate Scholarship Recipient and Dean’s Honors List

## Research and Projects  

**Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning Project (under review)**  
Developed a large-scale multi-objective RL system with novel evaluation metrics and a heterogeneous GNN-based PPO knowledge distillation framework. Presented at SoCal CS REU Symposium 2025.

**Multi-Agent LLM Robotics**  
Designed agentic pipelines for physics-informed Neural Architecture Search and digital twin simulations, integrating OpenGL physics engines, Intel RealSense video input, and Sawyer Robots with ROS.

**Neural Network Diagram Generator**  
Created a full-stack Agentic RAG Gradio app to generate professional neural network diagrams using Anthropic and Gemini APIs, Supabase vector embeddings, and containerized deployment.

**When2Fly Web App**  
Developed a full-stack ride-sharing scheduling platform with ReactJS, ExpressJS, PostgreSQL, and GitHub Actions for automated CI/CD.
