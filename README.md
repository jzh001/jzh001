## About Me  

I’m an undergraduate researcher passionate about Machine Learning, Graph Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, and Large Language Models.  
My work spans multi-objective reinforcement learning, agentic multimodal workflows, and open-source tools bridging research with practice.

- Former Visiting Academic at USC’s Institute for Creative Technologies (U.S. DEVCOM Army Research Lab)  
- Undergraduate Researcher at UCLA Structures-Computer Interaction Lab (LLM-guided physics simulations & multi-agent systems)  
- First-author publication in Springer Social Network Analysis and Mining, cited by Spotify Research (2024)  
- 2025 Samueli Undergraduate Scholarship Recipient and Dean’s Honors List
